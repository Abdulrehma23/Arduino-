1 × L78L33 3.3V Voltage Regulator (Optional)
1 × LM7805 5V Voltage Regulator (Optional)
1 × Resettable Fuse PTC (300mA) (Optional)
LEDs & Indicators:

1 × 5mm Green LED
1 × 5mm Red LED
Resistors:

2 × 330Ω Resistors
1 × 10kΩ Resistor
Oscillator & Timing Components:

1 × 16MHz Crystal
2 × 22pF Ceramic Capacitors
Capacitors:

5 × 0.1µF Ceramic Capacitors
2 × 10µF Electrolytic Capacitors
1 × 0.1µF Capacitor
Diodes & Connectors:

1 × Diode 1N4001
1 × 28-Pin DIP Socket (For ATMega328 placement)
1 × Push Button Reset Switch
1 × 6-Pin Right Angle Header (For FTDI, Prolific, CH340, or USB-to-TTL for serial communication with a laptop) (Optional)
1 × DC Barrel Jack / USB Jack (Similar to Arduino)
1 × 2-Pin Screw Terminal
1 × 6-Pin ICSP Header (Optional)
Headers:

2 × 6-Pin Female Headers
2 × 8-Pin Female Headers
This list of components was carefully selected to design and assemble the Arduino-based system while ensuring compatibility and functionality.


First, we used Proteus to design the PCB layout. Once the design was finalized, we purchased a copper board to fabricate the PCB. The circuit pattern was transferred onto the board using an iron, and then it was etched in a ferric chloride (FeCl₃) solution to remove excess copper and define the wiring.

After the etching process, the board was cleaned and dried. We then attached the necessary electronic components and completed the circuit assembly by soldering.
